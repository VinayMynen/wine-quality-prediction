# wine-quality-prediction
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. Using the  Wine Quality dataset, we apply and evaluate multiple classifiers such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and visualize their performance using metrics like ROC AUC and confusion matrices.
